This is a project I did using a course that helped me build my first RESTful Web Service application with Java, Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA. Implemented some features like:

- User sign-up and User sign-in using Spring Security

- Email verification

- Password Reset

- Get user details API call

- Get a list of users API call and implement Pagination

- Update user details and Delete user details API calls

What did I learn?

- How to use Amazon AWS Simple Email Service(SES) to send and request to confirm the user email address, and learned how to generate and include the JSON Web Token in HTTP Request 

- I also used Postman HTTP client software to send: POST, GET, DELETE and PUT requests, as well as how to set needed HTTP Headers
